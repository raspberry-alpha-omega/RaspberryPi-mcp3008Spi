Drake - an SPI API in C for the Raspberry Pi 

Installation
------------

After cloning this repo, you should be able to just type "make" in the cloned directory. This will build the spi code and an example 
"test" which will send some values to SPI CS1. To run the example, type "./test".

( Original code based on a C++ example at https://github.com/halherta/RaspberryPi-mcp3008Spi - Thanks to Hussam Al-Hertani )
